# Browned Butter Salty Chocolate Chip with Chestnut Paste

### General Notes
* Upped white sugar content to try to achieve chewier cookies
* Replaced greek yogurt with milk to try for the same effect
* Lowered salt content in dough

### Tasting Notes
* a little on the sweet side, but VERY chewy and soft!
* This could be a winner!
