# Browned Butter Salty Chocolate Chip with Strawberry preserves

### General Notes
* The less sweet strawberry preserves I got from Trader Joe's is pretty key for this. I think the cookies would be too sweet otherwise.
* Would recommend coarse sea salt over Fleur de Sel

### Tasting Notes
* Strawberry preserves pairs pretty well in this cookie!
* Baked this at 350 in my oven... which might not be the same as 350 in Alex's oven? May try a lower temperature next time.
