# Browned Butter Salty Chocolate Chip with Caramel

### General Notes
Used 2oz apple sauce because ran out of butter
Used salted butter by accident
Upped salt content to try to make chewier / less sweet cookies
Switched semi-sweet to dark chocolate chips

### Tasting Notes
* THIS COOKIE IS AWFUL
* It tasted salty
* And not very soft
* Just don't do this...
