# Browned Butter Salty Chocolate Chip with Nutella

### General Notes
Sprinkling with salt AFTER cookie comes out of the oven ensures a more even distribution of salt throughout the cookie

### Tasting Notes
* The lowered sugar amount did make the cookie taste less sweet
* But they were also less chewy??
* Nutella stuffing is pretty awesome. Though almost redundant given that it's a chocolate chip cookie... with more chocolate
* Still pretty tasty though!
